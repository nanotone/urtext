## Sheep may safely graze

Yet another piano transcription of the aria "Sheep may safely graze" from J.S. Bach's "Hunting" cantata BWV 208.

I took inspiration from both Mary Howe's and Egon Petri's transcriptions, and added some light counterpoint and re-harmonization of my own. Of particular note is the first line of the B section, modulating from G minor to C minor (mm. 21-26), where the soprano line has been dropped on octave into a tenor line, and when it reaches its highest note (A♭) the harmony shifts to the Neapolitan.

The arrangement assumes comfort with reaches of tenths. In most cases, awkward tenths should be rolled, as in mm. 21 and 39, but m. 33 may be quite tricky to pull off while maintaining a delicate voicing. My left hand lands minor tenths fairly easily, and it has no trouble taking the first recorder's E♮.
