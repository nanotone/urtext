## Der Falke (The Falcon)

A piano transcription of Brahms's secular choral song "Der Falke", from his [op. 93a lieder](https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Lieder_and_Romances,_Op.93a_(Brahms,_Johannes)). I sang this during my time in the NEC Youth Chorale, and while I don't particularly care for the [Siegfried Kapper text](https://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=9140) it's set to, Brahms's harmonic movement in the latter half of the form is worth expanding upon.

After three stanzas of predictable strophic form in the home key F major, which I've turned into a miniature set of variations, Brahms bookends the last two stanzas with completely new music in D major. The remaining material in this section moves between D, G minor, and B♭ in a series of continuously rising modulations: D to G minor (V-i), G minor to B♭ (relative major), B♭ to D (augmented sixth cadence), then repeating the cycle.

Freed from the constraints of setting to text, I've taken the liberty of extending the last cycle by taking a long harmonic detour. The B♭ cadence first resolves deceptively into the distant key of F♯. Then, the music finds its way home via a rearranged stacking of the same rising modulations: F♯ to B minor (V-i), B minor to D (relative major), then familiarly to G (V-i) and B♭ (relative major) again.
