## Berceuse

A lullaby for piano and hummed ostinato. The ostinato is comfortably in baritone range (hence the clef), but can by hummed by any voice, or group of voices.

While the resemblance to Chopin's berceuse is obvious and intentional, there are also moments in the right-hand figuration that reference Chopin etudes, in particular op. 10/5 (on black keys) and op. 25/6 (in thirds). The form is more of a baroque triple-meter passacaglia, with a slow ground bass ostinato forming the basis of a set of variations.
