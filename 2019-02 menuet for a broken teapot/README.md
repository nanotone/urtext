## Menuet for a broken teapot

A little piece I wrote in one day after breaking a beloved artisan-made teapot.

The title is an obvious reference to Ravel's "Pavane for a dead princess," but this leisurely menuet is more closely modeled after the Menuet from his Le Tombeau de Couperin. Beyond the dance form itself, I've borrowed a couple elements from Ravel: the contrast between a somewhat contrapuntal menuet and a more chordal musette, and the trick of overlaying the menuet recapitulation with the musette's chordal theme (translated back to major key) in the left hand.

In my post-hoc reflection on the piece, the menuet corresponds to an appreciation for delicate but practical artisan ceramics, whereas the musette corresponds to grief over the ephemerality of such objects.
